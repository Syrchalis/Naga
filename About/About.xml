    <description>Adds a playable naga race
    
The Naga are an advanced race that inhabits mostly space ships and stations and can occassionally be found on planets as well. They mostly offer their services as mercenaries, but not just as soldiers, but also as weapon manufacturers and doctors.

Requires Humanoid Alien Framework loaded before this
Harvest Yield Patch is not required, but highly recommended, otherwise some aspects of the race won't work as I intended them to.

Advantages:
- Chance to get higher quality when crafting/building/scultping
- Can craft plasma versions of normal weapons (slightly better stats)
- Venomous melee
- Don't care about butchering/eating humanlikes
- Fast
- Somewhat resistant against heat
- Resistant to toxins
- Very good with guns
- Good doctors
- Good traders
- Slightly better research speed and learning rate
- Fast smithing, tailoring and drug production

Disadvantages:
- Very fragile (huge penalty! they can take a lot less than humans, keep them out of harms way)
- Weak melee
- Bad with plants
- Vulnerable to the cold
- Vulnerable to psychic phenomena
- Slow constructing, plant work and unskilled labor
- Severely reduced plant harvest yield at low plant levels (slowly catch up to humans at higher skill)
- Get severely reduced nutrition from anything containing or consisting of vegetables
- Humans dislike Naga (relation penalty)
- Bad negotiators
- Cannot wear pants (obviously)</description>
